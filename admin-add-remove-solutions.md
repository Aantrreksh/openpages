# Adding and removing solutions
{: #add_remove_solutions}

You can add one or more solutions to your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance. When you add a solution, you can use the object types that belong to the solution. Youâ€™re billed for the solutions that you use. {: shortdesc}

To add a solution:
1. Go to the console where you manage your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance. For more information, see [How to manage your IBM OpenPages instance](/docs-draft/openpages?topic=openpages-manage_op_instance). 
4. On the **Manage** page, click **Manage Solutions**.
5. To learn about a solution, click its name.
6. To add a solution, click the toggle.
7. Click **Update**.

It can take several minutes for the process to complete. When the update is complete, the {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} overview page is displayed.

To remove a solution:
1. Go to the console where you manage your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance. For more information, see [How to manage your IBM OpenPages instance](/docs-draft/openpages?topic=openpages-manage_op_instance).
4. On the **Manage** page, click **Manage Solutions**.
5. Click the toggle of the solution that you want to remove.

Removing a solution does not delete any data in {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}. When you remove a solution, only your entitlement to the solution changes. {: .note}
