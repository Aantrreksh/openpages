# Adding groups to your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance
{: #iam-adding-groups}

You can create a group to organize a set of users into a single entity. Groups make it easier for you to assign access because you can assign a single policy to the group instead of assigning the same access multiple times for an individual user. For more information, see [Setting up access groups](/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=ui).

Groups are synchronized to {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} when they are created. For more information, see [User and group synchronization from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}}](/docs-draft/openpages?topic=openpages-iam-openpages-synchronization&interface=api).
