1. Log in to https://cloud.ibm.com/login by using your IBMid.

4. Select the **Essentials** plan or the **Standard** plan 
5. Do the following steps:
    - Type a **Service Name** for your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance. This will be the name of the first (dev) environment created for you. 
      - For the beta, your **AWS region** is automatically set to **US East (Virginia)** and cannot be changed.
      - You can change the base currency or use the default value.
      - You can choose to include sample data.
    - Click **Solutions** and choose at least one.
6. Read and agree to the terms, then click **Create**. Your {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} instance is being created.
7. To see the progress, go to the **Resource list**.
8. In the search box, type **openpages**. 

Your instance is listed twice because {{site.data.keyword.openpages_short}} is associated with two categories in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.

You might need to refresh the page to update it. Your instance is ready when the **Status** column shows **Active**. {: tip}
